    <h1> No joke, this IS the ultimate website</h1>
    <h2> Therefore I ask you, the corrector, a commentary conmemorating it's existence
      in the form of a written oath. <br>
      In the validation comment on Odyssey you shall write "I've never seen Brian in the kitchen."
      In order to pledge your allegiance (and well... to show that you have actually read this).<br>
      
      I salute you, and may courage be with you for these upcoming challenging months.
